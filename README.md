# Mapty
Welcome to the Mapty App project! This web application enables you to track your workouts by recording details such as location, distance, time, and other metrics using the browser's built-in geolocation and local storage APIs. You can start a new workout by choosing the activity type (running or cycling), entering the workout details, and clicking on the map to set the starting and ending points of your workout.

## Features

- Track your workouts by recording your location, distance, time, and other metrics.
- Choose between running or cycling as the type of activity.
- See your workouts on a map with different markers for each activity type.
- View a list of all your workouts with details such as distance, time, speed, and elevation gain.
- Edit or delete your workouts as needed.
- Save your workout data to local storage so that it persists even after you close the browser.
